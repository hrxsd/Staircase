# Plane Segmentation

## Overview

This is a C++ ROS package for extracting convex polygons from elevation maps.
In a first step, the terrain is segmented into planes, and their non-convex contour is extracted.
In a second step, a local convex approximation can be obtained.

## Usage

### Build

```bash
catkin build convex_plane_decomposition_ros
```

### Run as node

```bash
roslaunch convex_plane_decomposition_ros convex_plane_decomposition.launch
```

### Run demo

```bash
roslaunch convex_plane_decomposition_ros demo.launch
```

### Convex approximation demo

A simple 2D demo the convex inner approximation is available:

```bash
rosrun convex_plane_decomposition_ros convex_plane_decomposition_ros_TestShapeGrowing
```

### Parameters

You can select input map topics, pipeline parameters etc. in the respective yaml file in

```bash
convex_plane_decomposition_ros/config/
```

Some other parameters are set through the launch files.
